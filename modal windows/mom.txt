A modal in programming is a large user interface (UI) element that appears on top of an application's main window. Modals are modal windows, overlays, dialogs, or lightboxes. They can be transparent, allowing users to see the main app while interacting with the modal. Modals are often used for specific workflows, such as adding deleting or sharing content. They can also be used to display critical information or actions that require review or completion before returning to the main page or task flow.
